## Tasks

The issuance requests comes with the [Tasks][3] features. It means that every 
request may contain a set of pending tasks that should be resolved by master.
The request may become approved only if all tasks are resolved. 

To make the request approved automatically, source needs to create it with 
`allTasks` set to `0`. If source hasn't provided any tasks (the `allTasks` 
parameter is neither defined nor set to `0`), tasks will be taken
from the [Key Value storage][1] by key `issuance_tasks:{asset code}` 
(e.g. `issuance_tasks:BTC`);

### Possible tasks

Source is not allowed to set core flags.
